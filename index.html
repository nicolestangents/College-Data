<p>Ranking data for this map was sourced from U.S. News. Along with this, location (latitude/longitude), admissions rate (ADM_RATE), tuition (TUITIONFEE_), and public/private status (CONTROL_PEPS) were sourced from College Scorecard. It should be noted that College Scorecard data is from 2022 (for the class of 2026).</p>
<p>We feel this graphic is important in highligting that a <b>majority of top 50 schools are concentrated on the two coasts (particularly the East Coast) and the Midwest</b>. The result of this could mean that students who live in middle America but want to go to a top 50 university will have to go farther from home. Despite CA, TX, and FL being the most populous states, TX only has two top 50 universities and FL only has one. </p>

    <p>Data for this graphic was sourced from U.S News 2025 Best National University Rankings. The goal of this graphic is to make rankings easily comprehensible and clear for readers, before they view our other more complex graphics below. This interactive allows readers to search for both university names and rankings, and separate each list into two pages. We hope this graphic serves as clear background information before readers view the rest of our site!</p>

<p>Data for this graphic was sourced from U.S. News rankings and College Kickstart, then compiled into a spreadsheet. U.S. News was used for the 2025 and 2016 rankings (2016 was found with the Wayback Machine), College Kickstart used for years 2024-2017. The colors chosen for our data correlate with school colors. Along with this, U.S. News often has schools tied for a certain rank — for example, if two schools are ranked #3, the list then skips to rank #5. To address this, the data shows how the 2025 top twenty schools have fluctuated in rankings throughout the past ten years. </p>
<p>With the exception of <span style="color: #E77500;">Princeton University</span> and <span style="color: #750014;">MIT</span> (#1 and #2 in rankings), <b>all schools have changed ranks</b>. Most notably, <span style="color: #000d74;">Columbia University</span> dropped from rank #2 to rank #18 in one year. This is because <span style="color: #000d74;">Columbia</span> was discovered to be reporting incorrect statistics to boost their ranking. <span style="color: #4E2A84;">Northwestern University</span> has gradually climbed the rankings over time, most recently jumping to rank #6. The unique format and structure of this graphic allows readers to see a more comprehensive and color coded view of how the rankings of the 2025 U.S. News & World Report have changed in the past 10 years.</p>

<p><b>Admissions rates</b> for the country’s most elite universities have <b>declined dramatically and rapidly</b> in the past 20 years. For example, <span style="color: #E77500;">Princeton University</span> — the highest-ranked post-secondary institution according to U.S. News & World Report — saw its acceptance rate decline more than 63% in the past two decades.</p> 
<p>Declines during this time frame were consistent between all 10 top-ranked universities in the Report’s ranking for this year. From 2004 to 2024, these schools collectively saw their admissions rate drop an average of about 73%. The <span style="color: #F25422;">California Institute of Technology</span> saw the biggest overall decline in its admittance rate from 2004 to 2023 at about 82% (acceptance rate statistics were not available for <span style="color: #F25422;">Caltech</span> or <span style="color: #8C1515;">Stanford University</span> for the Class of ’28).</p>
<p><span style="color: #4E2A84;">Northwestern University</span> experienced the largest overall decrease in its acceptance rate by percentage points of all the ranked universities in the past two decades, from 33.26% for the Class of ’08 to 7.50% for the Class of ’28.</p> 
<p>The acceptance rate drops have been attributed to a larger number of students applying to a larger number of schools in recent admissions cycles. Top universities haven’t necessarily lowered their incoming class sizes — the application pool <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherrim/2023/11/22/ivy-league-acceptance-rates-are-plummeting-but-not-for-the-reason-you-may-think/">has simply increased</a>, causing more selectiveness. 
  The adoption of a “test-optional” approach at top schools since the COVID-19 pandemic, by removing requirements for applicants to submit ACT and SAT test scores, has also accelerated growth in the number of overall applicants.</p>
<p>Admissions rate information for the Class of 2008 through Class of 2026 was collected from College Scorecard datasets from the U.S. Department of Education for each of those years. Data for the Class of 2027 and 2028 was unavailable through the Department of Education. Instead, this information was collected through online sources listed in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-rKaU5EapZ8plP3LAhHNbWYXZIViB-vK6LxVdvUQdiU/edit?gid=0#gid=0">publicly available dataset</a>. The acceptance rate for <span style="color: #8C1515;">Stanford University</span> and the <span style="color: #F25422;">California Institute of Technology</span> for the Class of 2028 were both unavailable. We feel that this graphic is important for readers to visualize the stark changes in university acceptance rates overtime.</p>
